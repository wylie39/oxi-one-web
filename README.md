# OxiOneWeb

This is an unofficial web tool for working with the [OXI One](https://oxiinstruments.com/oxi-one/)
As of now, it supports:
* Getting projects
* Sending projects
* Deleting projects

The projects are stored in zip files but if unzip them they will work with the official app

Road map:
* Rename project
* Get and Send a single pattern
* Midi export
* Midi import
